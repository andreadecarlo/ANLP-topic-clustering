The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
Passing `generation_config` together with generation-related arguments=({'max_new_tokens', 'do_sample', 'repetition_penalty'}) is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Please pass either a `generation_config` object OR all generation parameters explicitly, but not both.
